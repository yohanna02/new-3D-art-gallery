## 3D Art Gallery Tutorial using Three.js

I made this live coding tutorial about "how to create an interactive 3D Art Gallery using Three.js". This project is perfect for artists or designers to exhibit their artwork portfolios or projects. The full tutorial is almost 8 hours long, and is divided into parts. Please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel if you are interested.

## Installation

You need Node.js installed on your computer.
And VSCode as an Editor.
Download link:

- https://nodejs.org
- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

After cloning, or downloading the zip file, on GitHub (green button `<> Code`) open your terminal, and run:

```bash
  npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.
"node_modules" folder will appear at the left in the Explorer files in VsCode.

Then run:

```bash
  cd src
```

to change path to src folder.

Then run:

```bash
  npx vite
```

to run the local server.
You'll see the URL address and the info help. Like for example:

```bash
  VITE v4.3.1  ready in 1759 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://123.4.5.6:7890/
